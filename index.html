        <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <p1 id="intro" class="para">
        A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
         which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies
          are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology a distributed ledger enforced
           by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that 
           they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically 
           immune to government interference or manipulation.

<h3>
    Brief History
</h3>
        <p>
            In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic 
            electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,
            an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in
             order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before 
             it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable
              by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.
              In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: 
              the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system,
               first publishing it in an MIT mailing list and later in 1997, in The American
                Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4).
                In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", characterized as an anonymous,
                 distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, 
                 Nick Szabo described bit gold.Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
                  that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based
                   exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required
            users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically
             put together and published.
            The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by
             developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256,
             a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.
             In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming
             a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult.
             Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It used scrypt as its
            hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin
             used a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.
             On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies,
             and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether
             regulation should be considered.[16]

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A cryptocurrency is a new form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across
                 a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control
                  of governments and central authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
                The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure the network.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data,
                 is an essential component of many cryptocurrencies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons, including their use for illegal activities, exchange rate 
                volatility, and vulnerabilities of the infrastructure underlying them. However, they also have been praised for 
                their portability, divisibility, inflation resistance, and transparency.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for the secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual 
            "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption
             algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, 
             public-private key 
             pairs, and hashing functions.</p>

             <h3>Types Of Cryptocurrency</h3>
             <p>
                 BItcoin still remains the most popular and most valuable cryptocurrency today. However, there are thousands of 
                 alternate cryptocurrencies 
                 with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new 
                 currencies that were built from scratch.
                 Some of the competing cryptocurrencies spawned by Bitcoin’s success, known as "altcoins," include Litecoin, 
                 Peercoin, and Namecoin, as well as Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. Today, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies 
                 in existence is around $214 billion—Bitcoin currently represents more than 68% of the total value.

            <h2>
                Pros and Cons Of Cryptocurrency
            </h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a 
        trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are instead secured by the use of public keys and 
        private keys and different forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
        In modern cryptocurrency systems, a user's "wallet," or account address, has a public key, while the private key is known only 
        to the owner and is used to sign transactions. Fund transfers are completed with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid
         the steep fees charged by banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.</p>


         <p>The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities, 
             such as money laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity, 
             citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive governments. 
             Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others. 
             Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business online, since the forensic 
            analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped authorities to arrest and prosecute criminals. More privacy-oriented 
            coins do exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult to trace.</p>

        <h2>Apps Associated</h2>
        <p>
            In lieu of how lucrative the crypto business has become, software developers have made various apps that 
            can be used for  various transactions using cryptocurrency.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><img class="coinbase" src="coinbase.png" alt="coinbase">Coinbase
                    
                </li>
                Among the easier apps to use on this list, Coinbase allows users to transfer
                 money directly from their bank account into their CoinBase wallet.
                 The app also features a dashboard and price alerts for users to keep track of their cryptocurrency,
                  and it is kept secure via multi-stage verification and password lock capability.
                  <br><br>
                <li>Blockchain</li>
                Named after the technology that makes cryptocurrency possible, this wallet app not only
                 allows users to buy and sell through it, but also allows for the sending and reception of a variety
                  of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stellar Lumens.
                Blockchain wallet accounts can be secured via email verification, 
                   two-factor verification and back-up security phrase.<br><br>

                <li>Bitnob</li>
                Another easy to app. Bitnob links to your real time bank account and lets you invest in bicoin
                by taking a certain amount you select from your account and converts it to bitcoin equivalent.
                You can also send and recieve bitcoin on the app. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency for transaction
                now
